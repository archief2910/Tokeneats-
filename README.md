ICP based project 
College students frequently miss meals in the campus mess, causing them to lose the prepaid mess fees for these unclaimed meals. This financial burden affects students, particularly those with tight budgets, and there's a need for an effective solution. Additionally, students often do not receive rebates for missed meals. Our project utilizes ICP to tackle the problem of students losing their prepaid mess fees due to missed meals. It establishes a transparent and accountable system for managing meal tokens, ensuring that students are refunded or credited for meals they miss.
